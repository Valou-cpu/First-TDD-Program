# First-TDD-Program

This is my first try at a TDD (Test Driven Development) program, I followed 2 tutorials for it, one a the dev.to website (https://dev.to/pat_the99/basics-of-javascript-test-driven-development-tdd-with-jest-o3c), and the other one is a YouTube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfTkMjccTzc).
